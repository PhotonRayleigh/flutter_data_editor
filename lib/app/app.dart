/* 
    8/30/2021
    Upgraded navigation system. Added a global navigation controller that
    holds global application routes.

    Updated navigation drawer to look nicer and accept the new system.

    Next: I want to start building the editor part of the data editor.
    This will require:
      - Interface for viewing/modifying data.
      - A way to select a file to open.
      - A way to make a new file, edit it, and save it
      - And I want to be able to view the raw text of a file.

    I'll start with JSON as the file format since that has good support
    from Dart out of the box. I'll move to support SQLite after.

    TODO: The global navigator isn't getting updated when the file browser
    goes back. Fix that.
